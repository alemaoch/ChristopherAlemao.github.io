Welcome to Christopher Alemao's Web Page! 

#Intro

Making a word or PDF document about my resume was boring, so I wanted to create a webpage that will bring life to the words!

I enjoy creating "stuff" and I think the process of creativity is found in the "doing". 

Coding allows me to explore different solutions to problems, and although I am not an expert, I strive to be better each and everyday! 

I hope to use Machine Learning to deliver solutions that enable smarter decisions and more effective outcomes , so that customers can overcome obstacles, achieve their ideas and pursue their dreams. 

I hope you enjoy this webpage about myself as much as I did making it!

-Chris
